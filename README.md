### Description

This application makes it easier to keep track of departments and employees by allowing the user (possibly a high level employee of business owner) to add departments, roles, and employees to a database and to view and edit them if necessary.

### Installation

Clone this repository and run employee_managementDB.sql in MySQL.

### Usage

This application is for anyone managing a business. Run "node index" in the terminal while in this repository and navigate through the prompt to build your employee database.

### Contributing

Contribute any way you'd like. You may optimize it or improve it.

### Tests

Run "node index" while in this repository on your machine, select "departments", select "add a department", continue through the prompt to add the department. After adding the department, it will return to start. Select "roles", select "add a role", continue through the prompt to add the role. If this role is not manager, then you will not be able to add employees yet because if the employee you want to add is a manager, they will have no role to fill, and if the employee you want to add is not a manager, they will have no manager to be assigned to. Once you've added a role of "manager", select "employees", select "add an employee", continue through the prompt to add the employee. You may view what you've added by navigating to either "departments", "roles", or employees and choosing the selections that start with "view".
